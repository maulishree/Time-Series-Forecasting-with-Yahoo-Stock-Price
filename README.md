# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Yahoo-Stock-Price


## Problem Statement

One of the traditional methods to predict the future stock price is the time series forecasting which is capable of predicting future values based on previously observed values. In this project we aim to perform time series analysis and forecasting of Yahoo stock prices to predict the future 5 values (Column name : “Close”).  Here, we also tried to understand the short term and long term drivers of stock prices.
